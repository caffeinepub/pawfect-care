      "reason": "While frontend/index.css is modified, the diff summary provides no direct evidence that duplicate/conflicting theme token definitions across frontend/index.css and frontend/src/index.css were removed/merged, or that runtime stylesheet loading was adjusted to ensure only one authoritative set of CSS variables applies in production.",
