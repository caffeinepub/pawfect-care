  "summary": "The diff adds a base-path-safe asset URL helper and a SafeImage component with themed loading/error fallbacks, and updates the landing page to import/use them (partial evidence due to truncation). However, the diff does not show the required uploaded static image file(s) (notably image-18.png) being added to the repository/build assets, so inclusion of user-uploaded images in the build output cannot be verified from the changes shown.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-15",
      "requirement": "Ensure all user-uploaded images required by the landing page are included in the frontend build output as static assets, including the newly uploaded image-18.png, and that filenames referenced in code exactly match files present in the built app.",
      "reason": "The diff shows code changes referencing assets and mentions image-18.png in a summary, but no actual image files (e.g., image-18.png under a public/static assets directory) are added/modified in the provided diff summary, so the presence of the required uploaded images in the build output cannot be confirmed.",
