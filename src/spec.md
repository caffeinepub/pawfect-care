# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Expand the Pawfect Care landing page to better match a Chewy/VetCare-style layout with clearer grooming overview, membership messaging, trust signals, richer services, stronger blue theme accents, and end-of-page FAQ/help content while cohesively incorporating all uploaded images.

**Planned changes:**
- Add a new “What is Pawfect Care” overview section before Services, in English and grooming-focused, including trust copy about ~100s of vendor partners and being Chewy-verified, with a mix of spa-cat and bath imagery.
- Add a “Membership plans” section (Chewy/VetCare-inspired styling) describing availability and benefits in simple bullets, with no prices shown.
- Update theme tokens so primary links/buttons and key accents use a darker Chewy-like blue (not the current lighter blue), while keeping primary text readable and aligned to the existing token approach.
- Add a “Convenient access to care” row/section with a mobile-in-hand icon preceding the heading and grooming-focused copy (booking, updates, care notes).
- Expand Services to include Nail Trimming and Teeth Cleaning as explicit service items/cards with appropriate icons and matching card styling, using uploaded imagery where it fits best.
- Place all uploaded images across relevant sections and add a dedicated end-of-page image gallery/strip (before the footer), ensuring consistent sizing/cropping/spacing and fixing any broken image paths.
- Add end-of-page “FAQs” (accordion) and “Need help?” sections modeled after the Chewy VetCare reference layout but customized for grooming, with English copy and contact placeholders in a Chewy-style blue panel.

**User-visible outcome:** Visitors see a longer, Chewy/VetCare-inspired Pawfect Care grooming landing page with a new overview, membership info (no pricing), updated darker blue CTAs/links, added “Convenient access to care,” expanded services (including Nail Trimming and Teeth Cleaning), an end-of-page FAQ + support panel, and all uploaded images displayed correctly (including a final gallery/strip).
